Bike Rental Sharing Demand Prediction

Project Overview:

This project analyzes bike rental data to predict demand based on weather and time-related factors. Multiple regression models were trained and compared to identify the best-performing approach. The final model was deployed using Streamlit for real-time predictions.

Project Workflow:

  Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand demand patterns.

  Preprocessed data (encoding, normalization, feature engineering).

  Built and compared regression models:

    Decision Tree

    Random Forest

    Gradient Boosting

  Applied hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV.

  Selected Gradient Boosting as the final model (~94% R² score).

  Deployed the model using Streamlit.

Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Streamlit, Joblib
